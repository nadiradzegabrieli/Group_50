      <p>Made By Nadiradzee</p>
      <h3>Web Development:
        Web development involves creating websites, web applications, and other web-related tasks. It’s often broken into several other sub-branches which are arguably big enough to stand as a separate branch in the programming world.
        
        These branches are Frontend web development, Backend web development and full-stack web development, these are three big branches that you might want to look into separately.
        
        To become productive in this field, you can start with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which mostly take care of the whole world of web development, while after starting your journey depending on your research strength, you can later pick up some other language for whatever sub-branch you want to venture into, but generally the aforementioned tools are the very first a web developer would focus on.
        
        Becoming productive as a beginner or self-taught web developer can take about 6–12 months to learn and get to a stage where you can start talking about your portfolio and getting started to get yourself a job in the field.
        
        2. Mobile App Development:
        
        Mobile app development involves creating mobile applications for Android and iOS devices. although the two operating system doesn’t sync, there are still under the same branch.
        
        To become productive in this field, you can start with Java or Kotlin for Android app development and Swift for iOS app development, saying theses, have it in mind that there is still some language that allows you to write code in them and you can easily compile to any os of your choice.
        
        These programming languages/frameworks are generally known as cross-platform frameworks and people that work with them are named cross-platform developers, the two most popular frameworks/ programming languages for cross-platform development are Flutter/Dart which is backed by Google and React-native/Javascript backed by Facebook(now META).
        
        Saying this, you probably can never go wrong choosing this branch of software programming, and specializing in these can take about 6–12 months to learn, while mastering and building a strong portfolio would take some months after.
        
        3. Game Development:

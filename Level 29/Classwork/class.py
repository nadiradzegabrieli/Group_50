#It initializes a list with the elements [8, 4, 2, 6].

# It initializes a list with the elements [8, 4, 2, 6].

# It removes the element 2 from the list.

# It prints the sum of the length of the modified list and the count of the element 6 in the modified list.

# Let's break it down step-by-step:

# list = [8, 4, 2, 6] - The list is [8, 4, 2, 6].

# list.remove(2) - This removes the element 2 from the list, resulting in [8, 4, 6].

# print(len(list) + list.count(6)) - The length of the modified list is 3 and the count of 6 in the list is 1. So, 3 + 1 = 4.

# Therefore, the output of the code will be 4.

# The task is to write a program that takes an input, adds it to the end of a queue (represented by a list), and then outputs the resulting list. The hint provided suggests using the append() method to add new items to the list.
